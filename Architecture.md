# 🏗️ Todoist Monorepo Architecture

*A Simple Guide to Understanding Our Project Structure*

---

## 🎯 What is This Project?

Imagine you're building a **digital treehouse** where people can keep track of their daily tasks (like a todo list). This treehouse has two main parts:

1. **The Backend** - Like the foundation and plumbing of the treehouse (handles data, security, etc.)
2. **The Frontend** - Like the pretty rooms and windows people see and use

Instead of building these in separate places, we put everything in **one big toolbox** called a **monorepo** (mono = one, repo = toolbox).

---

## 🧠 Why Use a Monorepo? (The Big Toolbox Approach)

### 🤔 The Problem
Imagine you're building a LEGO castle, but you keep all the red bricks in one room, blue bricks in another room, and instruction manuals in a third room. Every time you want to build something, you have to:
- Run to the red room
- Run to the blue room  
- Run to the instruction room
- Try to remember what you were doing

**This is what happens when you keep backend and frontend in separate repositories!**

### ✅ The Solution (Monorepo)
Now imagine you have **one magic toolbox** that contains:
- All your LEGO bricks (backend + frontend)
- All instruction manuals (documentation)
- All the tools you need (build scripts, deployment configs)
- Everything organized in labeled compartments

**This is our monorepo!** Everything you need is in one place.

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown of Each Part

### 🏗️ **backend/** - The Foundation

**What it is:** The backend is like the **engine of a car**. You don't see it, but it makes everything work.

**What it does:**
- **Stores data** (like a giant filing cabinet for todos)
- **Handles security** (like a bouncer at a club)
- **Processes requests** (like a chef taking orders and making food)
- **Manages the database** (like a librarian organizing books)

**Why FastAPI + PostgreSQL:**
- **FastAPI** = Like a super-fast waiter who never gets tired
- **PostgreSQL** = Like a super-organized library that never loses books

**Files inside:**
- `pyproject.toml` = Recipe for building the backend
- `requirements.txt` = Shopping list of ingredients needed
- `requirements-dev.txt` = Extra tools for developers (like a chef's special knives)

### 🎨 **frontend/** - The Pretty Rooms

**What it is:** The frontend is like the **interior of a house**. It's what people see and interact with.

**What it does:**
- **Shows beautiful pages** (like decorating rooms)
- **Handles user clicks** (like light switches that actually work)
- **Displays data** (like picture frames showing family photos)
- **Makes everything interactive** (like a remote control for your house)

**Why React + TypeScript:**
- **React** = Like LEGO blocks that snap together to build rooms
- **TypeScript** = Like instruction manuals that prevent you from putting the wrong blocks together

**Files inside:**
- `package.json` = Shopping list for frontend ingredients
- `src/` = Where all the room blueprints are kept

### 🔧 **shared/** - The Common Tool Shed

**What it is:** Imagine you have tools that both the foundation crew AND the interior designers need to use.

**Instead of buying two hammers, you keep ONE hammer in a shared toolshed.**

**What goes here:**
- **Types** = Like labels that say "this is a hammer" or "this is a screwdriver"
- **Utilities** = Like a universal tool that works for everyone
- **Constants** = Like a rulebook that says "always use blue screws"

**Why this is smart:**
- No duplicate tools (saves money)
- Everyone uses the same tools (consistency)
- If you upgrade a tool, everyone gets the upgrade

### 🚀 **infrastructure/** - The Deployment Blueprints

**What it is:** These are like **instruction manuals for building your treehouse in different locations**.

**Think of it like this:**
- You designed an amazing treehouse
- Your friend wants the same treehouse in their backyard
- Your cousin wants it in their backyard too
- Your grandma wants it in her garden

**Infrastructure folder contains:**
- `terraform/` = Like a robot that builds your treehouse automatically
- `kubernetes/` = Like instructions for building MANY treehouses at once
- `docker/` = Like a blueprint that works in any backyard

**Why we need this:**
- **Consistency** = Every treehouse is built exactly the same way
- **Automation** = No human mistakes when building
- **Scalability** = Can build 1 treehouse or 1000 treehouses easily

### 📚 **docs/** - The Instruction Manuals

**What it is:** Remember when you bought a complex toy and it came with a manual? This is our manual collection.

**What goes here:**
- **API Documentation** = How to talk to the backend (like a phrase book for a foreign country)
- **User Guides** = How to use the frontend (like a TV remote manual)
- **Developer Guides** = How to add new features (like advanced LEGO building techniques)
- **Troubleshooting** = What to do when things break (like a first-aid guide)

**Why this is important:**
- **New team members** can learn quickly
- **Users** know how to use the app
- **Developers** remember how things work (even they forget!)
- **Less questions** = More time for building cool stuff

## 🎮 The Magic Remote Control (Makefile)

### 🤔 What is a Makefile?

Imagine you have a **universal remote control** that can:
- Turn on your TV
- Set the temperature
- Start your coffee maker
- Turn on the lights
- All with ONE button press

**That's what our Makefile does for our project!**

### 🎯 Why Use Makefile Instead of Other Tools?

**The Problem with Multiple Languages:**
- Backend uses Python commands (`python main.py`)
- Frontend uses Node.js commands (`npm start`)
- Docker uses Docker commands (`docker-compose up`)
- Database uses SQL commands

**It's like having 4 different remote controls for your entertainment system!**

### ✅ The Makefile Solution

**One Remote Control for Everything:**
```makefile
make dev          # "Start Everything" button
make test         # "Test Everything" button
make build        # "Build Everything" button
make deploy       # "Deploy Everything" button
```

**Think of it like this:**
- **Before Makefile:** "Hey, to start the project, first run `cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`, then open another terminal and run `cd frontend && npm start`, then..."
- **With Makefile:** "Hey, to start the project, just run `make dev`"

### 🎪 Our Makefile Commands Explained

| Command | What It Does | Like... |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `make dev` | Starts everything for development | Pressing the "Start Movie Night" button (turns on TV, sound system, lights) |
| `make test` | Runs all tests | Pressing the "Check Everything Works" button |
| `make build` | Builds everything for production | Pressing the "Prepare for Party" button (cleans house, sets up decorations) |
| `make clean` | Cleans up everything | Pressing the "Clean Up After Party" button |
| `make help` | Shows all available commands | Pressing the "What Can This Remote Do?" button |

## 🐳 Docker: The Magic Moving Box

### 🤔 What is Docker?

Imagine you built an amazing LEGO castle in your room. Now you want to show it to your friend, but:
- Their room is different from yours
- They don't have the same table
- They don't have the same lighting

**Docker is like a MAGIC BOX that:**
- Puts your castle inside
- Brings the table, lighting, and everything else needed
- Your friend opens the box and BOOM! Perfect castle in their room

### 🎯 Why We Use Docker

**The Problem Without Docker:**
- "It works on my computer" 😅
- Developer A has Python 3.9, Developer B has Python 3.11
- Production server has different settings
- Frontend needs Node.js 18, but server has Node.js 16

**The Solution With Docker:**
- **Everyone gets the exact same box**
- **Box contains everything needed**
- **Works the same everywhere**

### 📦 Our Docker Files

| File | What It Does | Like... |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `Dockerfile.backend` | Recipe for backend box | Instructions for packing the engine |
| `Dockerfile.frontend` | Recipe for frontend box | Instructions for packing the pretty rooms |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Recipe for development playground | Instructions for setting up play area |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Recipe for production factory | Instructions for setting up real business |

## 🌐 Nginx: The Traffic Director

### 🤔 What is Nginx?

Imagine you're running a **pizza restaurant** and you have:
- **Kitchen** (backend) - Makes the pizza
- **Dining room** (frontend) - Where customers eat
- **Customers** coming in

**Nginx is like the HOSTESS who:**
- Greets customers at the door
- Decides where to seat them
- Directs orders to the kitchen
- Brings food back to tables
- Handles complaints and special requests

### 🎯 Why We Need Nginx

**Without Nginx:**
- Customers get confused about where to go
- Kitchen gets overwhelmed with direct orders
- No one handles security
- Chaos! 😱

**With Nginx:**
- **Organized traffic flow**
- **Security at the door**
- **Load balancing** (if kitchen is busy, wait politely)
- **Caching** (keeps popular items ready)

### 📋 Our Nginx Files

| File | What It Does | Like... |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `nginx.conf` | Development hostess | Friendly hostess for family dinner |
| `nginx.prod.conf` | Production hostess | Professional hostess for fancy restaurant |
| `nginx.frontend.conf` | Frontend-only hostess | Hostess just for the dining room |

## 🔐 Environment Variables: The Secret Settings

### 🤔 What are Environment Variables?

Imagine you have a **secret diary** with all your passwords, favorite colors, and secret hideout locations. You don't want to write these secrets in your regular notebook that everyone can see.

**Environment variables are like that secret diary for your application!**

### 🎯 What Goes in Our Secret Diary (.env file)

```env
# Database secrets (like your diary lock combination)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/todoist_dev

# Security secrets (like your superhero identity)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Application settings (like your favorite ice cream flavor)
ENVIRONMENT=development
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### 🔒 Why We Use .env.example

**Think of it like this:**
- `.env` = Your actual secret diary (never share this!)
- `.env.example` = A template that says "Dear diary, my password is ______, my favorite color is ______"

**This way:**
- New team members know what secrets they need
- They fill in their own secrets
- No one accidentally shares real secrets

---

## 🚀 Development vs Production: Home vs Restaurant

## 🧩 How Everything Works Together

### 🎼 The Orchestra Analogy

Imagine our project is like a **big orchestra**:

- **Backend** = The **drums** (keeps the rhythm, foundation)
- **Frontend** = The **violins** (beautiful melodies people hear)
- **Database** = The **sheet music** (stores all the songs)
- **Nginx** = The **conductor** (directs traffic between instruments)
- **Docker** = The **concert hall** (provides perfect acoustics everywhere)
- **Makefile** = The **conductor's baton** (starts, stops, controls everything)

### 🎵 The Performance Flow

1. **Conductor raises baton** (`make dev`)
2. **Concert hall prepares** (Docker containers start)
3. **Conductor directs traffic** (Nginx routes requests)
4. **Drums start playing** (Backend processes requests)
5. **Violins join in** (Frontend shows beautiful interface)
6. **Audience enjoys** (Users use the application)
7. **Sheet music guides** (Database provides data)

**Everyone plays together in perfect harmony!**
